### About Me

>My travel to web development started 6 yar ago when I began to study HTML and CSS basics. Already starting from this insensibly started to grow interest in this field of activity. My first project can't be said that was good, but this was the beginning of the way to the profession of a web developer.

>Having practiced on a couple of projects the understanding come to make multifunctional sites one layout is not enough. The next step was interest in PHP programming. Website development has become even more interesting because I now can make not static, but sites that could store variable data in a DB.

>Then I become interested in how I can speed up the creation of sites using ready-made solution. I've worked with such CMS as Joomla, Opencart and Wordpress. In practice I worked more with Wordpress, over time I even liked it. Had to work with outdated themes, fix kernel and theme compatibitity bugs. This prompted me to study more PHP and JavaScript. The process self-study and at the same time work was so exсiting that days and night paseed quickly.

>Every project I worked on became my brainchild, for which I am very worried. I try to be very responsible in development.
